# dm-crypt / LUKS

`dm-crypt` is a block-level encryption `target` for the Linux `Device Mapper` framework. In general `dm` is used for mapping physical block devices to higher level virtual block devices, usually for logical volume manager (LVM), encryption or RAID. `dm-crypt` provides the transparent encryption and decryption of block devices using the kernel crypto API.

## Encryption types:

There are two main types of encrypted volumes provided by `dm-crypt`:

- **plain:** Provides basic encryption. Plain encrypts the device sector-by-sector with a single non-salted hash of the passphrase. Plain does not provide any headers or metadata on the encrypted device and the encryption key cannot be changed or revoked.
- **LUKS:** LUKS provides a header at the start of the device then a key slot area directly behind then the rest of the encrypted data, named a LUKS container/device. With LUKS; multiple passphrases can be used where each can be changed or revoked, these individual passphrases are stored in key slots. The LUKS header can also be detached and stored on a separate device for adaptive security measures.

There is also limited support for the below encryption types:

- loop-AES
- TrueCrypt
- VeraCrypt
- BitLocker
- FileVault2

## cryptsetup:

`cryptsetup(8)` is a utility for managing `dm-crypt`. This is documented in [dm-crypt](../../CheatSheet.md#dm-crypt).
