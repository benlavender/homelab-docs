# PipeWire

PipeWire is a modern low-level multimedia framework and daemon that aims to both capture and playback minimal latency audio and video. It aims to be the successor to PulseAudio. It supports PulseAudio, JACK, ALSA and GStreamer-based applications.

PipeWire is a complete re-implementation of a PulseAudio and JACK server but still uses `ALSA` for audio and `bluez5` for bluetooth as well as `PulseAudio` for the client API.

PipeWire supports application containers like Flatpak.
